# PWM_Signal_Drawer
*PWM Drawer Project Description:

PWM drawer works as a mini oscilloscope that is responsible for printing the frequency and the waveform of the generated PWM signal. The generated wave came from two internal or external sources.

With the graphical LCD, we can display the following: 

• The shape of the generated PWM from internal or external sources. 

• The frequency in Hz of the generated wave on the upper left side of the LCD. 

• The duty cycle of the generated wave on the upper right side of the LCD. 

• The time of the single cycle.
